## Future Improvement Areas
1. Server Side Rendering (SSR):
	- Implement SSR to improve initial page load times and enhance SEO.
	- Use frameworks like Next.js or Nuxt.js to facilitate SSR in the application.
	- Optimize server-rendered pages by minimizing the amount of JavaScript sent to the client.
	- Implement caching strategies for server-rendered pages to reduce server load and improve response times.
	- Ensure that SSR pages are properly hydrated on the client side to maintain interactivity.

2. Performance Optimization:
	- Implement code splitting and lazy loading to reduce initial load time.
	- Optimize images and other assets.
	- Use a service worker for caching and offline support.
	- Minimize and compress CSS and JavaScript files.

3. Feature Flag:
	- Integrate with third-party feature flag services such as LaunchDarkly to manage feature rollouts.
	- Use feature flags to enable or disable features without deploying new code.
	- Implement a strategy for gradual feature rollouts and A/B testing.
	- Ensure that feature flags are properly documented and maintained.
	- Create a process for regularly reviewing and cleaning up outdated feature flags.
	- Monitor the impact of feature flags on application performance and user experience.

4. Tracking:
	- Integrate with third-party monitoring and tracking services such as Amplitude to monitor application performance.
	- Set up event tracking to capture user interactions and behaviors.
	- Use tracking data to identify and analyze user engagement and retention metrics.
	- Implement dashboards to visualize key performance indicators (KPIs) and trends.
	- Ensure compliance with privacy regulations such as GDPR and CCPA when collecting and storing user data.
	- Regularly review and update tracking configurations to align with evolving business goals and user needs.

5. Accessibility:
	- Ensure the application is fully accessible to users with disabilities.
	- Use semantic HTML and ARIA roles.
	- Implement keyboard navigation and screen reader support.

6. Testing:
	- Increase test coverage with unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests.
	- Use testing libraries like Jest, React Testing Library, and Cypress.

7. Internationalization (i18n):
	- Add support for multiple languages.
	- Use libraries like react-i18next for managing translations.

8. Security:
	- Implement security best practices to protect against common vulnerabilities.
	- Use tools like Snyk to scan for vulnerabilities in dependencies.

9. Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):
	- Set up CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.
	- Use services like GitHub Actions, Travis CI, or CircleCI.

10. Progressive Web App (PWA):
	- Convert the application into a Progressive Web App with business need.
	- Implement features like push notifications and background sync.
